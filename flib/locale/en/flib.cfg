[mod-setting-description]
flib-dictionary-levels-per-batch=How many translation "levels" (sets of 20 translations) to nest in each dictionary batch. Decrease this number if you run into multiplayer timeout issues.
flib-translations-per-tick=How many translation operations to perform per tick. Decrease this number if you are being dropped from a multiplayer game due to slow internet.\n\nDecreasing the number will reduce bandwidth usage, but translations will take longer to complete.
